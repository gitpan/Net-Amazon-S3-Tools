=head1 NAME

s3ls - List S3 buckets and bucket contents

=head1 SYNOPSIS

s3ls [options]

s3ls [options] [ [ bucket | bucket/item ] ...]

 Options:
   --access-key    AWS Access Key ID
   --secret-key    AWS Secret Access Key
   --long
 Environment:
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item B<--help>

Print a brief help message and exits.

=item B<--man>

Prints the manual page and exits.

=item B<--verbose>

Output what is being done as it is done.

=item B<--access-key> and B<--secret-key>

Specify the "AWS Access Key Identifiers" for the AWS account.
B<--access-key> is the "Access Key ID", and B<--secret-key> is
the "Secret Access Key".  These are effectively the "username" and
"password" to the AWS account, and should be kept confidential.

The access keys MUST be specified, either via these command line
parameters, or via the B<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID> and
B<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET> environment variables.

Specifying them on the command line overrides the environment
variables.

=item B<--secure>

Uses SSL/TLS HTTPS to communicate with the AWS service, instead of
HTTP.

=item B<--long>

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

=over 8

=item B<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID> and B<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET>

Specify the "AWS Access Key Identifiers" for the AWS account.
B<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID> contains the "Access Key ID", and
B<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET> contains the "Secret Access Key".  These are
effectively the "username" and "password" to the AWS service, and
should be kept confidential.

The access keys MUST be specified, either via these environment
variables, or via the B<--access-key> and B<--secret-key> command line
parameters.

If the command line parameters are set, they override these
environment variables.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

The configuration options will be read from the file C<~/.s3-tools> if it
exists.  The format is the same as the command line options with one option
per line.  For example, the file could contain:

    --access-key <AWS access key>
    --secret-key <AWS secret key>
    --secure

This example configuration file would specify the AWS access keys and that a
secure connection using HTTPS should be used for all communications.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lists the buckets owned by the user, or all the item keys in a given
bucket, or attributes associated with a given item.

If no buckets or bucket/itemkey is specified on the command line, all
the buckets owned by the user are listed.

If the C<--long> option is specified, the creation date of each bucket
is also output.

If a bucket name is specified on the command line, all the item keys
in that bucket are listed.

If the C<--long> option is specified, the ID and display string of the
item owner, the creation date, the MD5, and the size of the item are
also output.

If a bucket name and an item key, seperated by a slash character, is
specified on the command line, then the bucket name and the item key
are output.  This is useful to check that the item actually exists.

If the C<--long> option is specified, all the HTTP attributes of the
item are also output.  This will include Content-Length, Content-Type,
ETag (which is the MD5 of the item contents), and Last-Modifed.

It may also include the HTTP attributes Content-Language, Expires,
Cache-Control, Content-Disposition, and Content-Encoding.

It will also include any x-amz- metadata headers.

=head1 BUGS

Report bugs to Mark Atwood L<mark@fallenpegasus.com>.

Occasionally the S3 service will randomly fail for no externally
apparent reason.  When that happens, this tool should retry, with a
delay and a backoff.

Access to the S3 service can be authenticated with a X.509
certificate, instead of via the "AWS Access Key Identifiers".  This
tool should support that.

It might be useful to be able to specify the "AWS Access Key
Identifiers" in the user's C<~/.netrc> file.  This tool should support
that.

Errors and warnings are very "Perl-ish", and can be confusing.

Trying to access a bucket or item that does not exist or is not
accessable by the user generates less than helpful error messages.

This tool does not efficiently handle listing huge buckets, as it
downloads and parses the entire bucket listing, before it outputs
anything.

This tool does not take advantage of the prefix, delimiter, and
hierarchy features of the AWS S3 key listing API.
