=head1 NAME

s3rmbucket - Delete Amazon AWS S3 buckets

=head1 SYNOPSIS

s3rmbucket [options] [bucket ...]

 Options:
   --access-key    AWS Access Key ID
   --secret-key    AWS Secret Access Key
 Environment:
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item B<--help>

Print a brief help message and exits.

=item B<--man>

Prints the manual page and exits.

=item B<--verbose>

Print a message for each created bucket.

=item B<--access-key> and B<--secret-key>

Specify the "AWS Access Key Identifiers" for the AWS account.
B<--access-key> is the "Access Key ID", and B<--secret-key> is
the "Secret Access Key".  These are effectively the "username" and
"password" to the AWS account, and should be kept confidential.

The access keys MUST be specified, either via these command line
parameters, or via the B<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID> and
B<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET> environment variables.

Specifying them on the command line overrides the environment
variables.

=item B<--secure>

Uses SSL/TLS HTTPS to communicate with the AWS service, instead of
HTTP.

=item B<bucket>

One or more bucket names.  As many as possible will be deleted.

A bucket may only be deleted if it is empty.

Bucket names must be between 3 and 255 characters long, and can only
contain alphanumeric characters, underscore, period, and dash.  Bucket
names are case sensitive.

If a bucket name begins with one or more dashes, it might be mistaken
for a command line option.  If this is the case, separate the command
line options from the bucket names with two dashes, like so:

  s3rmbucket --verbose -- --bucketname


=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

=over 8

=item B<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID> and B<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET>

Specify the "AWS Access Key Identifiers" for the AWS account.
B<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID> contains the "Access Key ID", and
B<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET> contains the "Secret Access Key".  These are
effectively the "username" and "password" to the AWS service, and
should be kept confidential.

The access keys MUST be specified, either via these environment
variables, or via the B<--access-key> and B<--secret-key> command line
parameters.

If the command line parameters are set, they override these
environment variables.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

The configuration options will be read from the file C<~/.s3-tools> if it
exists.  The format is the same as the command line options with one option
per line.  For example, the file could contain:

    --access-key <AWS access key>
    --secret-key <AWS secret key>
    --secure

This example configuration file would specify the AWS access keys and that a
secure connection using HTTPS should be used for all communications.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Delete buckets in the Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3).
A bucket may only be deleted if it is empty.

=head1 BUGS

Report bugs to Mark Atwood L<mark@fallenpegasus.com>.

Occasionally the S3 service will randomly fail for no externally
apparent reason.  When that happens, this tool should retry, with a
delay and a backoff.

Access to the S3 service can be authenticated with a X.509
certificate, instead of via the "AWS Access Key Identifiers".  This
tool should support that.

It might be useful to be able to specify the "AWS Access Key
Identifiers" in the user's C<~/.netrc> file.  This tool should support
that.

Some errors and warnings are very "Perl-ish", and can be confusing.

A bucket can only be deleted if it is empty.  It might be useful
to add an option to delete every item in the bucket before then
deleting it, similar to the semantics of the C<rm -rf dir> command.
This tool should support that.
